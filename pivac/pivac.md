# pivac — context summary

`pivac` is the HVAC/home-monitoring daemon running on the Raspberry Pi at `10.0.0.82` (external `68lookout.dglc.com`). Full project context, architecture, services, and remote-desktop setup live in:
- `~/github/pivac/CLAUDE.md` (project-specific, on the Pi)
- `~/github/claude-contexts/pi-CLAUDE.md` (Pi-wide infrastructure: backup procedure, journald, cursor fix, etc.)

This file exists for Mac-side Claude sessions that need to drive Pi operations remotely. The main thing it covers right now is the **backup runbook**.

## Current State

*Updated 2026-05-08*

**Last worked on**: NAS backup architecture is now operational. Resumed yesterday's stalled bootstrap (D-state NFS procs cleared after reboot), validated SSH+dd as the bootstrap path, and completed the full 55 GB sparse `.img` to `/volume1/pi-backups/pivac.img` in ~2h 8min. Benchmarked the first NAS-direct incremental at **127 seconds**, which validates the original BAU plan (NFS-direct incrementals don't hit the rsync sparse-file pathology — only initial bulk copy does). Built and installed `nas-image-backup.{service,timer}` for monthly automated runs (1st of month @ 03:00 EDT). Updated pi-CLAUDE.md (architecture marked running, bootstrap caveat preserved for future NAS rebuilds) and pivac/CLAUDE.md (brief Backup Automation subsection). **PR #44 open** for the timer code.

**Next steps**:
1. Merge PR #44 (`feature/nas-backup-timer`) — backup automation script + service + timer + brief CLAUDE.md mention
2. Verify the first scheduled run on 2026-06-01 ~03:00 EDT via `journalctl -u nas-image-backup.service` and confirm the .img mtime advances on the NAS
3. (deferred) Hot-recovery rpi-clone layer pending USB SD reader + spare card purchase
4. (deferred) Verify the `redlink-stale` Grafana alert fires the next time pivac-redlink is offline >30m

**Notes**:
- BAU validated: rsync-over-NFS sparse pathology only bites on initial bulk copy of the sparse .img. Incrementals into a loop-mounted .img are normal block writes and finish in 2 minutes.
- Fresh-bootstrap recipe (for NAS rebuild): `image-backup -i` to local SSD, then `cat src.img | ssh root@10.0.0.3 'dd of=/volume1/pi-backups/pivac.img conv=sparse bs=4M status=progress'`. Now documented in pi-CLAUDE.md.
- Local SSD copy at `/mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` retained as a cold spare. The SSD is unmounted by default (no fstab entry).
- NAS SSH access: `root@10.0.0.3` works via key for ad-hoc commands. `nasadmin` key not configured — wasn't needed once SSH+dd worked.
- Tooling memory updated this week in `~/.claude/memory/tools/`: `synology.md`, `rsync.md`, `nfs.md`, `m365-graph.md` — relevant for the next backup-side incident.

## Backup Runbook (drivable from a Mac Claude session)

The Pi backs up to LookoutNas (DS225+ at `10.0.0.3`) using RonR's `image-utils` (rsync-based, produces a directly bootable `.img`). Architecture and one-time infrastructure (NFS mount, ACL fix, share setup) are documented in `pi-CLAUDE.md`'s `## Backup` section — that work is already done. What follows is the procedure to actually run a backup.

### Connection

The Mac has passwordless SSH to the Pi as user `pi` (`ssh pi@10.0.0.82`). The Pi has passwordless SSH **as root** to the NAS (`ssh root@10.0.0.3`).

### Phase 1 — bootstrap initial image to the temp SSD (one-time, ~15 min)

**Preconditions to verify before running:**
- Temp SSD is plugged into the Pi and mounted at `/mnt/tempssd` (1.8 TB SanDisk Extreme, ext4). Check: `ssh pi@10.0.0.82 'df -h /mnt/tempssd'`
- image-utils is at `/home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/`
- No backup has been run yet (the `/mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` file does not exist — `-i` will refuse to overwrite)

**Run from the Mac, inside `tmux` for resilience** (RDP/SSH drop kills foreground commands):
```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.82
tmux new -s backup
sudo systemctl stop pivac-1wire pivac-redlink pivac-gpio pivac-arduino-psi pivac-arduino-therm-psi pivac-emporia pivac-sentry signalk influxdb nginx
sudo /home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/image-backup -i /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img
sudo systemctl start nginx signalk influxdb pivac-1wire pivac-redlink pivac-gpio pivac-arduino-psi pivac-arduino-therm-psi pivac-emporia pivac-sentry
```
Detach tmux: `Ctrl-b d`. Reattach: `tmux attach -t backup`.

**Expected output**: image-backup creates partitions inside the .img file, formats them, then rsyncs the live system into the loopback-mounted partitions. ~10–15 min for ~53 GB to local ext4 (~50–100 MB/s). The script prints rsync progress.

**Success signals:**
- Final line of `image-backup` says something like "image-backup completed successfully"
- `ls -la /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` shows a ~119 GB file (sparse — actual usage close to the source's 53 GB)
- All systemd services come back up: `systemctl status pivac-* signalk influxdb nginx | grep "Active:"` all show `active (running)`
- Grafana dashboards resume updating once Signal K + InfluxDB are back

### Phase 2 — ship the bootstrap .img to the NAS

```bash
sudo mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups   # uses the noauto fstab entry
sudo rsync -avS --progress /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img /mnt/nas-pi-backups/
sudo umount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
```
`-S` preserves sparse-ness so we don't transmit empty bytes. ~10–20 min on gigabit (sequential — best case for NFS).

Alternative if NFS-mount is unhappy: `sudo rsync -avS --progress /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img root@10.0.0.3:/volume1/pi-backups/` (uses the existing root SSH key).

### Phase 3 — verify

```bash
sudo mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
sudo /home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/image-info /mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img
ls -la /mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img
sudo umount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
```
`image-info` should show two valid partitions (boot vfat + root ext4). Size should match what was on the SSD.

### Phase 4 — detach the temp SSD

David needs the SSD back. After Phase 2 completes:
```bash
sudo umount /mnt/tempssd
sudo eject /dev/sda
```
Then David physically unplugs.

### Going forward

Monthly cron will run `image-backup` (no `-i`) against `/mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img` directly — incremental rsync of only changed files. The cron + service-stop wrapper script isn't yet written; create it as `/usr/local/bin/pivac-monthly-backup.sh` with the same stop/start service list as Phase 1, and add an entry to `/etc/cron.d/`.

A weekly `rpi-clone` backup to a USB SD reader + spare card is also planned but on hold until David buys the hardware.

### Restore (for reference, not part of bootstrap)

To restore from a `.img` on the NAS:
1. Mount the NAS share on a Mac (or any machine with Raspberry Pi Imager)
2. In Pi Imager: "Use Custom" → select `pivac.img` → write to a fresh SD card (≥ 128 GB)
3. Insert the new SD into the Pi and boot. The first boot will auto-expand the root filesystem to the full card.
4. To pick a specific historical version, mount the matching DSM snapshot of the `pi-backups` share before reading the .img.

### Known gotchas

- Run inside `tmux` — xrdp/SSH drops will SIGHUP a foreground rsync.
- The first time you `mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups`, all NAS access must be done as root (`sudo`). The share's ACL only grants `user:root` and `group:administrators`. Non-root Pi users get permission-denied even though the unix bits look open. This is by design.
- If image-backup ever complains about missing `parted`, `losetup`, `kpartx`, or `rsync`: install with `sudo apt install -y parted kpartx rsync` (all should already be present on Raspberry Pi OS).
