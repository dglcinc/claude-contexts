# pivac — context summary

`pivac` is the HVAC/home-monitoring daemon running on the Raspberry Pi at `10.0.0.82` (external `68lookout.dglc.com`). Full project context, architecture, services, and remote-desktop setup live in:
- `~/github/pivac/CLAUDE.md` (project-specific, on the Pi)
- `~/github/claude-contexts/pi-CLAUDE.md` (Pi-wide infrastructure: backup procedure, journald, cursor fix, etc.)

This file exists for Mac-side Claude sessions that need to drive Pi operations remotely. The main thing it covers right now is the **backup runbook**.

## Current State

> ### ▶ ACTIVE HANDOFF — the new I/O board passed all eleven channels on a bench Pi (2026-09-06 evening, M2)
>
> **`new-pivac` is a Pi 4 Model B Rev 1.5** (`eth0` `2c:cf:67:80:55:00`, DHCP `10.0.0.40` wired,
> `10.0.0.44` WiFi) on a fresh Trixie Lite (2026-06-18) 64 GB card: user `pi`, password same as
> hostname, David's ssh keys, I2C on. `scripts/io-board-test.py` (**PR #159**, open) proves each
> channel from the Pi side; a transition watcher over ssh saw all 11 plug positions pull only their
> own pin low and release cleanly. No LED-row bridges, all three chips seated right. Build-doc Step 8
> now names the script; the rework plan records the new MAC.
>
> **Flashing lesson:** from this Mac's Terminal, `authopen -w` buffers all of stdin in RAM (killed at
> 3 GB) and root `dd`/Imager CLI under `osascript` hit TCC "Operation not permitted". The Imager GUI
> writes fine, but its customisation left only the stock commented cloud-init templates, so the real
> config went onto `bootfs` by hand (`user-data`, `meta-data` with `dsmode: local`, `network-config`).
> Trixie Lite has `pinctrl`, no `raspi-gpio`; `i2cdetect` is in `/usr/sbin`; BCM 9–27 default to
> pull-down, so set `ip pu` before reading the board.
>
> **Next:** merge #159. Bench round 2 when the DS2482 board is built (`i2cdetect -y 1` → `0x18`).
> Step 9 sweep + field wiring. Cutover per rework plan §6: clone-based build, move the `10.0.0.82`
> reservation to the new MAC, and **quarantine the clone's first LAN boot** (mask
> `nas-image-backup.timer`, `sd-clone.timer`, `pivac-redlink`, `pivac-emporia`,
> `grafana-graph-bridge`; the clone's `wlan0` fixed `10.0.0.130` collides). **Carried:** decide #117;
> extend `sentry-warp-search.py` to the LED/indicator coords; Chiltrix tuning change 2; `r284`/`P65`
> confirmations; loop-probe swing and strain-relief checks; Wilhelm #155/#156 device test.

## Backup Runbook (drivable from a Mac Claude session)

The Pi backs up to LookoutNas (DS225+ at `10.0.0.3`) using RonR's `image-utils` (rsync-based, produces a directly bootable `.img`). Architecture and one-time infrastructure (NFS mount, ACL fix, share setup) are documented in `pi-CLAUDE.md`'s `## Backup` section — that work is already done. What follows is the procedure to actually run a backup.

### Connection

The Mac has passwordless SSH to the Pi as user `pi` (`ssh pi@10.0.0.82`). The Pi has passwordless SSH **as root** to the NAS (`ssh root@10.0.0.3`).

### Phase 1 — bootstrap initial image to the temp SSD (one-time, ~15 min)

**Preconditions to verify before running:**
- Temp SSD is plugged into the Pi and mounted at `/mnt/tempssd` (1.8 TB SanDisk Extreme, ext4). Check: `ssh pi@10.0.0.82 'df -h /mnt/tempssd'`
- image-utils is at `/home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/`
- No backup has been run yet (the `/mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` file does not exist — `-i` will refuse to overwrite)

**Run from the Mac, inside `tmux` for resilience** (RDP/SSH drop kills foreground commands):
```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.82
tmux new -s backup
sudo systemctl stop pivac-1wire pivac-redlink pivac-gpio pivac-arduino-psi pivac-arduino-therm-psi pivac-emporia pivac-sentry signalk influxdb nginx
sudo /home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/image-backup -i /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img
sudo systemctl start nginx signalk influxdb pivac-1wire pivac-redlink pivac-gpio pivac-arduino-psi pivac-arduino-therm-psi pivac-emporia pivac-sentry
```
Detach tmux: `Ctrl-b d`. Reattach: `tmux attach -t backup`.

**Expected output**: image-backup creates partitions inside the .img file, formats them, then rsyncs the live system into the loopback-mounted partitions. ~10–15 min for ~53 GB to local ext4 (~50–100 MB/s). The script prints rsync progress.

**Success signals:**
- Final line of `image-backup` says something like "image-backup completed successfully"
- `ls -la /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` shows a ~119 GB file (sparse — actual usage close to the source's 53 GB)
- All systemd services come back up: `systemctl status pivac-* signalk influxdb nginx | grep "Active:"` all show `active (running)`
- Grafana dashboards resume updating once Signal K + InfluxDB are back

### Phase 2 — ship the bootstrap .img to the NAS

```bash
sudo mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups   # uses the noauto fstab entry
sudo rsync -avS --progress /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img /mnt/nas-pi-backups/
sudo umount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
```
`-S` preserves sparse-ness so we don't transmit empty bytes. ~10–20 min on gigabit (sequential — best case for NFS).

Alternative if NFS-mount is unhappy: `sudo rsync -avS --progress /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img root@10.0.0.3:/volume1/pi-backups/` (uses the existing root SSH key).

### Phase 3 — verify

```bash
sudo mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
sudo /home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/image-info /mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img
ls -la /mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img
sudo umount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
```
`image-info` should show two valid partitions (boot vfat + root ext4). Size should match what was on the SSD.

### Phase 4 — detach the temp SSD

David needs the SSD back. After Phase 2 completes:
```bash
sudo umount /mnt/tempssd
sudo eject /dev/sda
```
Then David physically unplugs.

### Going forward

`nas-image-backup.timer` runs `image-backup` (no `-i`) against `/mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img` on the 1st of each month at 03:00, stopping the disk-writing services first and restarting them on exit. `sd-clone.timer` runs `rpi-clone` to the spare card in the USB SD reader every Sunday at 02:00. Both are described under Backup Automation in `~/github/pivac/CLAUDE.md`.

### Restore (for reference, not part of bootstrap)

To restore from a `.img` on the NAS:
1. Mount the NAS share on a Mac (or any machine with Raspberry Pi Imager)
2. In Pi Imager: "Use Custom" → select `pivac.img` → write to a fresh SD card (≥ 128 GB)
3. Insert the new SD into the Pi and boot. The first boot will auto-expand the root filesystem to the full card.
4. To pick a specific historical version, mount the matching DSM snapshot of the `pi-backups` share before reading the .img.

### Known gotchas

- Run inside `tmux` — xrdp/SSH drops will SIGHUP a foreground rsync.
- The first time you `mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups`, all NAS access must be done as root (`sudo`). The share's ACL only grants `user:root` and `group:administrators`. Non-root Pi users get permission-denied even though the unix bits look open. This is by design.
- If image-backup ever complains about missing `parted`, `losetup`, `kpartx`, or `rsync`: install with `sudo apt install -y parted kpartx rsync` (all should already be present on Raspberry Pi OS).
