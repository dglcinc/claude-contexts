# pivac — context summary

`pivac` is the HVAC/home-monitoring daemon running on the Raspberry Pi at `10.0.0.82` (external `68lookout.dglc.com`). Full project context, architecture, services, and remote-desktop setup live in:
- `~/github/pivac/CLAUDE.md` (project-specific, on the Pi)
- `~/github/claude-contexts/pi-CLAUDE.md` (Pi-wide infrastructure: backup procedure, journald, cursor fix, etc.)

This file exists for Mac-side Claude sessions that need to drive Pi operations remotely. The main thing it covers right now is the **backup runbook**.

## Current State

*Updated 2026-05-31*

**Last worked on**: (1) Verified PR #54 RedLink token-expiry fix works in production — on 2026-05-29 21:34 EDT Honeywell returned 5×401 "Key Expired?" and the new `must_reset` path fired correctly (`RedLink token expired (401); resetting session`). (2) Documented the intentional `/etc/crontab` weekly Sunday-midnight `reboot now` cron in both `pi-CLAUDE.md` (cause) and pivac `CLAUDE.md` Known Operational Behaviours (RedLink cold-start effect) — commits `db2139d` (claude-contexts) and `f2933c1` (pivac). (3) **Live freshness incident**: outside-temp + 2 of 3 hydronic temp gauges stale. Two root causes — the OUT sensor `0516a365d8ff` dropped physically off the w1 bus, and a previously-undocumented **OneWireTherm cascade-failure bug** where one bad sensor's exception kills the whole module's cycle (since `pivac-provider.py:171` catches at module level). modprobe-reload + service restart did NOT recover the bus state (service crash-looped on `NoSensorFoundError`); user issued a full Pi reboot. (4) Documented the cascade-failure bug as a Known Operational Behaviour in pivac CLAUDE.md with fix shape (wrap per-sensor read in try/except).

**Next steps**:
1. **After reboot — verify clean recovery.** `systemctl status pivac-1wire pivac-redlink signalk` + `journalctl -u pivac-1wire -n 30` looking for clean cycles without `SensorNotReadyError` or `NoSensorFoundError`. Expected: IN, CRW, AMB publish; OUT (`0516a365d8ff`) remains absent.
2. **Fix the OneWireTherm cascade-failure bug** — wrap `sensor.get_temperature()` in a try/except inside the `for sensor in sensors` loop in `pivac/OneWireTherm.py`. Same isolation pattern as RedLink's `_refresh_one`. Without this fix, any one bad sensor takes down all temperatures until reboot.
3. **Physical-inspect the OUT hydronic sensor (`0516a365d8ff`)** — gone from the w1 bus. Until replaced/reconnected, the "Out" hydronic water-temp gauge stays stale.
4. *(carryover)* **NAS image-backup tomorrow 2026-06-01 ~03:06 EDT** — first auto-scheduled monthly run via `nas-image-backup.timer`. Check `journalctl -u nas-image-backup.service` after 03:30 and confirm `pivac.img` mtime advances on the NAS.
5. *(carryover)* **Physical card-swap boot test** — pull live SD, drop spare in, confirm boot. Still pending; needs hands at the Pi.
6. *(deferred)* Verify the `redlink-stale` Grafana alert fires the next time pivac-redlink is offline >30m.

**Notes**:
- **Reader hardware:** Anker USB 3.0 Micro SD Card Reader, USB `05e3:0764` (Genesys Logic chipset). Replaced the 4-LUN Insignia NS-DCR30A2 on 2026-05-09. The Anker is a 2-LUN device but the same `size > 0` filter handles single- and multi-slot readers identically.
- **Why VID:PID, not SCSI model:** Anker's SCSI model string is `MassStorageClass` — too generic to match safely (any USB stick reports it). VID:PID is unique to the actual reader.
- **Both timers installed and enabled.** `nas-image-backup.timer` (monthly, 1st @ 03:00 EDT) and `sd-clone.timer` (weekly, Sun @ 02:00 EDT +/− 15m jitter). 1h gap prevents collision when the 1st of a month falls on a Sunday.
- **rpi-clone is live-safe** — no service stop, unlike `image-backup` which requires service quiesce. A weekly clone that captures live state is fine for hot-recovery; the monthly NAS image is the consistent backup.
- **rpi-clone install:** source at `~/github/rpi-clone/` (billw2/rpi-clone), copied to `/usr/local/sbin/` — see pi-CLAUDE.md.
- **No redeploy needed for sd-clone.sh changes:** `/etc/systemd/system/sd-clone.service` references the in-repo path `/home/pi/github/pivac/scripts/sd-clone.sh` directly, so `git pull` after merge is sufficient.
- **Stacked-PR gotcha hit during PR #44 merge:** squash-merging a parent with `--delete-branch` auto-closes child PRs and blocks reopen. Recovery is cherry-pick onto new master + new PR. Documented globally in `~/.claude/memory/tools/gh-stacked-prs.md`.
- **OpenSprinkler `/sprinkler/` proxy** has no Basic Auth despite CLAUDE.md claiming it does — docs drifted, not blocking anything. Native OS app only works at root URL, not under a path prefix; if mobile-app access becomes important, set up `sprinkler.dglc.com` subdomain mirroring the bowling-app pattern.
- **Local SSD copy** at `/mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` retained as a cold spare; SSD unmounted by default.

## Backup Runbook (drivable from a Mac Claude session)

The Pi backs up to LookoutNas (DS225+ at `10.0.0.3`) using RonR's `image-utils` (rsync-based, produces a directly bootable `.img`). Architecture and one-time infrastructure (NFS mount, ACL fix, share setup) are documented in `pi-CLAUDE.md`'s `## Backup` section — that work is already done. What follows is the procedure to actually run a backup.

### Connection

The Mac has passwordless SSH to the Pi as user `pi` (`ssh pi@10.0.0.82`). The Pi has passwordless SSH **as root** to the NAS (`ssh root@10.0.0.3`).

### Phase 1 — bootstrap initial image to the temp SSD (one-time, ~15 min)

**Preconditions to verify before running:**
- Temp SSD is plugged into the Pi and mounted at `/mnt/tempssd` (1.8 TB SanDisk Extreme, ext4). Check: `ssh pi@10.0.0.82 'df -h /mnt/tempssd'`
- image-utils is at `/home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/`
- No backup has been run yet (the `/mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` file does not exist — `-i` will refuse to overwrite)

**Run from the Mac, inside `tmux` for resilience** (RDP/SSH drop kills foreground commands):
```bash
ssh pi@10.0.0.82
tmux new -s backup
sudo systemctl stop pivac-1wire pivac-redlink pivac-gpio pivac-arduino-psi pivac-arduino-therm-psi pivac-emporia pivac-sentry signalk influxdb nginx
sudo /home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/image-backup -i /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img
sudo systemctl start nginx signalk influxdb pivac-1wire pivac-redlink pivac-gpio pivac-arduino-psi pivac-arduino-therm-psi pivac-emporia pivac-sentry
```
Detach tmux: `Ctrl-b d`. Reattach: `tmux attach -t backup`.

**Expected output**: image-backup creates partitions inside the .img file, formats them, then rsyncs the live system into the loopback-mounted partitions. ~10–15 min for ~53 GB to local ext4 (~50–100 MB/s). The script prints rsync progress.

**Success signals:**
- Final line of `image-backup` says something like "image-backup completed successfully"
- `ls -la /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img` shows a ~119 GB file (sparse — actual usage close to the source's 53 GB)
- All systemd services come back up: `systemctl status pivac-* signalk influxdb nginx | grep "Active:"` all show `active (running)`
- Grafana dashboards resume updating once Signal K + InfluxDB are back

### Phase 2 — ship the bootstrap .img to the NAS

```bash
sudo mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups   # uses the noauto fstab entry
sudo rsync -avS --progress /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img /mnt/nas-pi-backups/
sudo umount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
```
`-S` preserves sparse-ness so we don't transmit empty bytes. ~10–20 min on gigabit (sequential — best case for NFS).

Alternative if NFS-mount is unhappy: `sudo rsync -avS --progress /mnt/tempssd/pivac.img root@10.0.0.3:/volume1/pi-backups/` (uses the existing root SSH key).

### Phase 3 — verify

```bash
sudo mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
sudo /home/pi/github/RonR-RPi-image-utils/image-info /mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img
ls -la /mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img
sudo umount /mnt/nas-pi-backups
```
`image-info` should show two valid partitions (boot vfat + root ext4). Size should match what was on the SSD.

### Phase 4 — detach the temp SSD

David needs the SSD back. After Phase 2 completes:
```bash
sudo umount /mnt/tempssd
sudo eject /dev/sda
```
Then David physically unplugs.

### Going forward

Monthly cron will run `image-backup` (no `-i`) against `/mnt/nas-pi-backups/pivac.img` directly — incremental rsync of only changed files. The cron + service-stop wrapper script isn't yet written; create it as `/usr/local/bin/pivac-monthly-backup.sh` with the same stop/start service list as Phase 1, and add an entry to `/etc/cron.d/`.

A weekly `rpi-clone` backup to a USB SD reader + spare card is also planned but on hold until David buys the hardware.

### Restore (for reference, not part of bootstrap)

To restore from a `.img` on the NAS:
1. Mount the NAS share on a Mac (or any machine with Raspberry Pi Imager)
2. In Pi Imager: "Use Custom" → select `pivac.img` → write to a fresh SD card (≥ 128 GB)
3. Insert the new SD into the Pi and boot. The first boot will auto-expand the root filesystem to the full card.
4. To pick a specific historical version, mount the matching DSM snapshot of the `pi-backups` share before reading the .img.

### Known gotchas

- Run inside `tmux` — xrdp/SSH drops will SIGHUP a foreground rsync.
- The first time you `mount /mnt/nas-pi-backups`, all NAS access must be done as root (`sudo`). The share's ACL only grants `user:root` and `group:administrators`. Non-root Pi users get permission-denied even though the unix bits look open. This is by design.
- If image-backup ever complains about missing `parted`, `losetup`, `kpartx`, or `rsync`: install with `sudo apt install -y parted kpartx rsync` (all should already be present on Raspberry Pi OS).
